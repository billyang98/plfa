# Programming Language Foundations in Agda

Code samples and exercise solutions for [Programming Language Foundations in Agda](https://plfa.github.io/), an online book by Philip Wadler and Wen Kokke. I'm working through it for the [SF Types, Theorems, and Programming Languages meetup](https://www.meetup.com/SF-Types-Theorems-and-Programming-Languages).
