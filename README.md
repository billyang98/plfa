# Programming Language Foundations in Agda

Code samples and exercise solutions for [Programming Language Foundations in Agda](https://plfa.github.io/), an online book by Philip Wadler and Wen Kokke. I'm working through it for the [SF Types, Theorems, and Programming Languages meetup](https://www.meetup.com/SF-Types-Theorems-and-Programming-Languages).

To verify the code yourself, make sure that you've

1. [installed](https://agda.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting-started/installation.html) Agda and its Emacs mode, and
1. added the standard library to your `libraries` file.

Then open up any of the `.agda` files in Emacs and type `C-c C-l` to typecheck it.
